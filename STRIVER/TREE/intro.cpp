.                                                NOTES OF TREES 

ðŸ“Œ Introduction to binary trees;


* Type of hierarchical data structure but can be implemented as dynamic.
* At most two children nodes

ðŸ“Œ main element at the top of tree is called as ROOT.
ðŸ“Œ it sub nodes are called as CHILDREN. 
ðŸ“Œ the node which does not have sub nodes are called as LEAF;

ðŸ“Œ SUB TREE just beneath the node
ðŸ“Œ ANCESTORS : the nodes which are above the particular node are the ancestors

ðŸ“ŒðŸ“ŒðŸ“Œ      TYPES OF BINARY TREE       ðŸ“ŒðŸ“ŒðŸ“Œ
1) FULL BINARY TREE 
   ->> either 0 or 2 children nodes in a tree are known as full binary tree.
2) COMPLETE BINARY TREE
   ->> all levels should be completely filled except the last level.
   ->> and the last level nodes should be as left as possible..
3) PERFECT BINARY TREE
   ->> all leaf nodes are at same level..
4) BALANCED BINARY TREE
   ->>height of the tree should be at max log(N)
5) DEGENERATE TREE
.   ->>every node has a single children...
