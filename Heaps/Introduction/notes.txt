                      HEAP 


IT IS A COMPLETE BINARY TREE THAT COMES WITH A HEAP ORDER PROPERTY 

WHAT IS COMPLETE BINARY TREE?
EVERY LEVEL IS COMPLETELY FILLED EXCEPT THE LAST LEVEL
NODES ALWAYS ADDED FROM THE LEFT LEAN TOWARDS RIGHT  

HEAP ORDER PROPERTY 
-> MAX HEAP (PARENT NODE>LEAF NODES)
-> MIN HEAP (LEAF NODE>PARENT NODE)

3. ðŸ§® Heap Representation (0-based indexing)
Typically implemented using arrays:

For node at index i:

Left Child â†’ 2i + 1

Right Child â†’ 2i + 2

Parent â†’ (i - 1) / 2

ðŸ”¢ Heap Representation (1-Based Indexing)
If your array starts at index 1 (common in many textbooks or competitive programming), the formulas are:

Relationship	Formula
Parent of i	i / 2
Left Child	2 * i
Right Child	2 * i + 1
